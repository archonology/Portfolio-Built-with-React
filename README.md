## Description
As I've learned new technologies, I decided to get more practice and implement some of the many things I've learned. This portfolio site isn't just a refactor of my former site (https://github.com/archonology/myPortfolio), it is a total rebuild from the ground up. 

This application is built with React and utilizes emailJS (https://www.emailjs.com/) to route messages to me from the contact form(no need for a back-end on a portfolio site). 

## Usage
To show how emailJS is functioning in my site, here is an example screenshot of a message being sent and the alert that pops up upon submission:
![screenshot](./src/components/images/sample%20message%20sent.png)

And after submitting, I get the following email: 
![screenshot](./src/components/images/sample%20message%20recieved.png)

    
## Technology
In addition to React and EmailJS, this application utilizes Bootstrap, and gh-pages(for deployment). In coming developments, I plan to utilize the React-Spring library, or Anime.js.  I believe less is more when it comes to animations, so I've decided to wait a bit and ponder where animations would really benefit the site.

## Gratitude
Thanks to my family for all their mind-blowing patience support as I've emmersed myself endlessly in the realms of computer language for the last many months. 

Thank you to the wonderful staff and support people at the U of MN Bootcamp, and lots of thanks to all you wonderful developers out there writing awesome documentation for Node libraries! I don't take it for granted just how much work and care goes into not only building wonderful libraries, but in finding ways to teach others how to best use them, too.
